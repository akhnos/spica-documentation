# Bucket

Buckets are the main foundation of Spica Development Engine. While creating a Bucket, the user defines a data schema. Once you create your bucket, Spica will generate Rest API endpoints automatically. So you can send an HTTP request to get/update/insert bucket data.

## Bucket Creation Steps

To create a bucket you need to define bucket name, description, and fields. You can also customize your bucket view and add rules to apply security checks. On the top bar, you'll see an icon as default. You can click to change the icon of the Bucket. That icon will be shown on the sidebar next to the Bucket title. While the Title is limited to 15 characters, the Description is limited to 250. Once you finish creating a new bucket, you will see it on navigator. Bucket ID will be assigned automatically so you can access your data via API. For more details visit API Reference.

:::caution
Until you finalize bucket creation steps, everything will be in memory. So if you change the page, your settings will be lost.
:::

## Properties

Here, in this section, you will define what kind of data the Bucket will hold. By default, Description and Title properties are created. You can delete those properties by clicking the red trash icon to start with a blank Bucket.

To enter a new property, find the text-box with "Enter a property name" placeholder. Enter a unique, lowercase property name and then click the button next to it to save.

:::note
Spica stores the property names as JSON keys. For this, special characters, spaces, and such are forbidden.
:::

You'll see the name of the newly created property is added to the list. Click on it to edit the property and its options.

:::caution
If you change a field type after the creation (e.g. changing a `string` field to `array`), that field's data on bucket entries will be **removed**.

### Property Options

`Primary field`: Primary field is mainly used for building relations between data.

`Translate`: Marks the field as translatable. For more information please check [Translation and Localization](###translation-and-localization) section.

### Validations

#### General Validations

- **Required**: Makes the field required. If the field is empty, the data won't be saved.
- **Read-only**: This one is used to prevent value changes on entry create and update.
- **Default value**: If the value is empty on data creation, this value will be placed instead.
- **Unique**: Makes sure each entry is unique. If not, the data won't be saved.
- **Index**: Reduces the response time of the query.

#### String

- **Define pattern**: Regex field to validate the string values. If the regex pattern doesn't match, the data won't be saved.
- **Make field enumerated**: If toggled on, only the given values will be accepted as field values. 

#### Number

- **Minimum and Maximum Values**: Constrains the number values. 

#### Array

- **Item should be unique**: If toggled on, each item in the array should be unique. Otherwise, the data won't be saved.
- **Minimum and Maximum Items**: The element length of the array should be within these boundaries. 

#### Relation 

- **Bucket**: Choose from which Bucket the relation will be.
- **One To One or One To Many**: Determines the relationship type.
- **Dependent**: If toggled on, makes the related document to dependent on the current document; if any entry gets deleted from the current bucket the system will delete the related document automatically.


### Some Examples

For the Bucket stores User information: 

Full Name: `string`

Age: `number`

Birthday: `date`

Bio: `richtext`

Address: `textarea`.

Avatar: `storage`

Current Location: `string`

![Example Bucket](/img/docs/bucket/bucket_example.png)

## View

You can customize the Bucket Data Create/Edit page from this section. Left, Right and Bottom represent the divisions of the layout on the Bucket Data Create/Edit page.

You can drag and drop the Bucket Properties to the desired division.

:::note
You can't save a Bucket if you left one or more Properties on the No Position list.

### Translation and Localization

**Bucket entries**, in Spica, are translatable and localizable out-of-the-box.

To set up the supported language of the Spica instance, navigate to **Bucket list** and find the Bucket Settings button on the sidebar next to the **Add New Bucket**. Click on it and you will see the available languages of the Spica instance. To add a new one, select the language from the Language Selection menu and press the **"+ Add new language"** button, and click to **Save**.

To add translation and localization features to a Bucket:

- Open the **Bucket schema edit page**.
- Find the field you would like to have translations
- Check the **Translate** option and save the Bucket

:::danger
This action is irreversible which means, once you make a field to have translations, you can't take it back.
:::

:::note
Only the following type of properties can have localization; `object`, `storage`, `string`, `textarea`, and `richtext`
:::

Once you save the Bucket, go to the Bucket Data Add page and you'll see a language selection next to the input of the multilingual property. You can select desired language code, entering a value and switch to another language, and so on.

The final form of a multilingual property will be like this:

```json
{...
  "text": {
    "en_US": "This is some text in English.",
    "es_ES": "Este es un texto en Espa√±ol."
  }
...}
```

## Rules

Bucket Rules are used to apply security checks to the data. It uses the ACR syntax and follows its rules. For more information about `Access Control Rules`, please visit [this page](/docs/additionals/access-control-rules.md).

## Auto-Publish

For scheduled publish, there is an auto-publish feature in the bucket module. So you can set a date for a specific entry and the system will make that particular entry available at that time. You can see all scheduled entries and published entries in different tabs. To get more details about accessing to scheduled entry, please see the API reference.

## History / Revisions

Spica optionally can track down the change history of bucket entries. To enable the history feature for the specific bucket, simply go to a Bucket Schema edit page and toggle the History option. Once it is toggled on, the changes made on the bucket's entries will be stored.

Navigate to one of the Bucket's entries, look for the **History** button on the top right toolbar. Clicking on it will reveal the last 10 versions of the entry. Clicking the version numbers will only show that version of the data. If you intend to revert the entry to a certain point, just click on the revision number then hit the save button.

## Limitations

Limitations are used to limit the Bucket's maximum number of documents. What comes after that limit is reached can be chosen; "Do not insert" or 
"Insert but delete the oldest".

## Real-time

This feature helps you to connect bucket collections and send `POST`, `PUT`, `GET`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` requests to the bucket data and their changes in real-time to handle constantly changing workloads. Unlike API calls, retrieved data will always be actual. You can skip some data rows or limit the amount of data you'll get. Sorting and filtering are also supported. A real-time bucket system is mostly useful for chat applications, reservation systems, and accounting.

## Generating ORM File

Spica CLI provides generating objects file commands to prepare your client project easier. To generate an ORM file in your local client project, you can use the commands below;


```bash
$ spica bucket orm --url <YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL> --apikey <YOUR_APIKEY> --path <FOLDER_PATH_TO_GENERATE>
```

:::note
You need to install Spica CLI with `npm install @spica/cli` before running any other command
:::

This command will generate a `bucket.ts` file in the path you indicated. The path parameter is optional. If you don't give the path parameter, it will generate the file where you run the command. After you generate the ORM file you can use your buckets like in the example below;

```typescript
// Let's say you have a user bucket in your project
import {user,User,initialize} from "./bucket.ts";

// You can use the initialize function with an API key as well
// Bucket.initialize({apikey: <APIKEY>}) 
constructor(){
  initialize({identity: <JWT_TOKEN>});
}

async function getUsers(){
  const allUsers: User[] = await user.getAll(...) // Now you can use every bucket library functions
  return allUsers;
}
```
